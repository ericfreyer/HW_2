In this assignment I created a website with a responsive design so it can be viewed on a wide variety of devices and screen sizes. I did this by utilizing bootstrap for most of the styling elements throughout the webpages. I created three pages including an "About me" page with info and links to info and contacts, a "portfolio" page of past work I've done as an art handler where I created links for the user to get more info on each project, and then finally a "contact" page. I know I don't have the proper tools to make the form send to anywhere (php?), but it was good practice creating one, regardless. Throughout the various pages I made sure the elements and images were responsive by looking at them on my computer first adjusting the window size, then looking on my Iphone. On the home and portfolio page I focused on using the bootstrap grid system to organize the content, and also took this opportunity to practice pushing my work often so there was a clear progression of my progress on Github.
